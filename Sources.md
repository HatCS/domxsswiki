## Introduction to sources
In software, data flow can be thought as in water flow in aqueduct systems which starts from natural sources and ends to sinks. In software security the sources are to be considered starting points where untrusted input data is taken by an application.

Sinks are meant to be the points in the flow where data depending from sources is used in a potentially dangerous way resulting in loss of Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability (the CIA triad).
